Iron Coder Project #2:  Word Madness Project

Summary:  To complete this challenge, prompt the user to input certain types of words and then plug those words into a short story.  

Stretch Goals:
    1)  Highlight the user's words in your story in some way, you can use any means you like to set the added words apart from the original story.
    2)  Have your solution present more than one story to choose from.
    3)  Create a file format to store the story information and then have your solution "play" the story.  This will allow your solution to play any number of stories that use the correct file format.
    4)  Your solution will not only play the game, it will make the game.  Supercharge your solution with the ability to turn any text into a playable mad lib.
